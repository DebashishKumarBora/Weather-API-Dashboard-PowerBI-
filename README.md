# Weather Analytics Dashboard using Power BI & WeatherAPI 🌦️

## 📌 Introduction
This project showcases an interactive **Weather Analytics Dashboard** built in **Power BI**, integrating real-time weather data from **WeatherAPI**. The dashboard visualizes key metrics like temperature, humidity, air quality index (AQI), forecast trends, rain probabilities, and more — demonstrating how external APIs can be harnessed for dynamic data storytelling in Power BI.

---

## 📊 Data Overview
The dashboard uses live data fetched from **WeatherAPI**, covering:
- Temperature (Current & Forecast)
- Humidity & Wind Speed
- Air Quality Index (PM10, PM2.5, CO, O3, NO2, SO2)
- Sunrise & Sunset Timings
- Rain Probability (%)
- Visibility & UV Index
- Atmospheric Pressure & Precipitation Levels

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
1. **API Integration** with Power BI for real-time weather metrics.
2. Design a **visually appealing weather dashboard** interface.
3. Transform & model API data within Power BI.
4. Provide **actionable weather insights** for end-users.
5. Demonstrate **dashboard interactivity** with live API data.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Extracted API data using **Power Query Editor**.
- Parsed JSON responses for structured table formats.
- Handled null/missing values and ensured consistent units.
- Aligned forecast data with actuals for trend visualization.
- Time-series formatting for seamless date-based analytics.
